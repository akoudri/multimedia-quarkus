/**
 * Maps UserBusinessException to HTTP 409 Conflict response.
 *
 * This handles business rule violations that prevent a user operation from completing.
 * The request is syntactically valid and validated, but business logic rejects it.
 *
 * Example scenarios:
 * - Attempting to activate an already active user account
 * - Trying to suspend a user who is already suspended
 * - Attempting to lock a user who is already locked
 * - Promoting a user who already has the target role
 * - Status transitions that violate the user lifecycle state machine
 *   (e.g., PENDING_VERIFICATION â†’ SUSPENDED without going through ACTIVE)
 * - Operations on archived users without restoration
 * - Attempting to delete a user account that hasn't been archived first
 *
 * Example JSON response:
 * {
 *   "message": "Cannot activate user: account is already active",
 *   "code": "USER_ALREADY_ACTIVE",
 *   "timestamp": "2024-03-20T10:15:30",
 *   "details": {
 *     "businessRule": "USER_ALREADY_ACTIVE"
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Example JSON response (without business rule code):
 * {
 *   "message": "Cannot suspend locked user account",
 *   "code": "BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION",
 *   "timestamp": "2024-03-20T10:15:30"
 * }
